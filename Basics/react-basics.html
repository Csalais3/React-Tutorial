 React is an external library that helps us create websites easier 
 1) React is an external library
 - Html code makes websites 
 - Htlm <script> element help us load JavaScript onto the website
 - We can also run JavaScript by saving JavaScript code in a file then import it into our main file by adding the scr attribute to load the code form the file
 - The script element can load code from anywhere on the internet (External Libary: Code that someone else wrote outside of our library)
 - This means that React is code that someone else wrote outside of our computer, we can load this code on our website and use it

 2) React helps us create websites easier

 The <html> <head> <body> structure is called the "HTML Structure", a standard structure followed when writing in html
 DOCTYPE! html tell the computer to use a modern version of html
 The html element represents a website, so all the code for the website 

 Each website is split into two sections
 Head: anything that you dont want visible inside of the page
 Body: contains things that are visible inside of the page, we put scripts at the end of the body to load all of the html elements firse
-->
<html>
  <head>
    <title>React Basics</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- This is a container that we give to react to keep things isolated -->
    <div class="js-container"></div>
    
    <!-- This is an example of an external library-->
    <!-- <script src= "https://unpkg.com/supersimpledev@8.6.4/external-library.js"> </script>
    -->

    <!-- These Two URLs load react into our website, there are several types of react libraries (react: Shared Features, react-dom: For websites, react-native: for apps)-->
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/supersimpledev/react.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/supersimpledev/react-dom.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/supersimpledev/dayjs.js"></script>

    <!-- This is another external library called Bable, which is a JavaScript compiler, translating our react language to JS.
         We are technically using a enhanced version of JS called JSX which is the same as JS but we can type HTML directly into the code 
         To use Babel, we have to first load the Babel external library, then when we want to add an attribute to the script element called type="text/babel" -->
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/supersimpledev/babel.js"></script>
    <script type="text/babel">
      // Example of HTML code inisde the JSX code
      const button = <button> hello </button>; // This code creates a new button element inside of our JS as a variable
      // In order to use this JSX, we must translate it to JS, which is what our Babel external library does, so that our web browser can understand it
      const paragraph = <p>paragraph of text</p> // HTML code to create a paragraph of text


      // These two lines of code set up react
      const container = document.querySelector('.js-container'); 
      // We are getting an html element from our website and putting it into JavaScript
      // Gives a Document Object, which is a combined version of JS and HTML, which allows them to interact with eachother (DOM Documetn Object Model)
      // We tell which html element we want from the website, looking for a class, then save it inside a variable

      // ReactDOM.createRoot(container).render('Welcome to SuperSimpleDev React Course');
      // This sets up react by giving it a html element, which acts a container, where each element created in react is going to be displayed into the element of html as a container, keeping everything organized and isolated (nothing outside can affect anything inside)
      // .render allows us to display something within the container, with the contents inside of the () specify what should be displayed

      // We can also diplay html elements inside the container, we give the button html element to the render function for example
      //ReactDOM.createRoot(container).render(button);
      //ReactDOM.createRoot(container).render(paragraph);

      // We can't give render multiple elements or save multiple elements in a single varibale and then render it
      // A div element is a container to contain multiple elements (useful for containing all our react elements)
      const cost = 0
      const price = 10
      const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(container);

      setInterval(() => {
        const div = (<div>
        <p> My name is Christian! Today is {dayjs().format('MMMM D, YYYY')}</p>
        <p> The current time is {dayjs().format('HH : mm : ss')}</p>
        <button>Good Job!</button>

        <p> Cotton Socks </p>
        <p> Price: ${price}</p>
        <button>Add to Cart</button>
        <p> Product cost: {price * cost}</p>
        </div>); // The {} gives us the ablility to add JS code within our jsx element (string interpolation)

        root.render(div)

      }, 1000);
    
    </script>
  </body>
</html>

<!--This is the minimum amount of code that is needed to set up react -->
